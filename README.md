# Cybersecurity Fundamentals

This repository contains my learning notes and practical exercises related to cybersecurity fundamentals.

Topics include:
- Networking fundamentals (OSI, TCP/IP, DNS, ICMP)
- Common cyber attacks and defensive concepts
- IDS/IPS and basic incident response
- Security tools fundamentals (Nmap, Wireshark)

This portfolio is a work in progress and will be continuously updated as I advance my studies.
